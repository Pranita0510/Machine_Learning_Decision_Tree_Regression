**ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Regression in Machine Learning:**

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Regressor using Scikit-learn. It is focused on solving regression problems by building a model that predicts continuous target values based on input features.

ðŸ“Œ Key Components:

Importing necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn)

Loading and exploring the dataset

Feature selection and preprocessing

Splitting data into training and testing sets

Building and training the DecisionTreeRegressor

Making predictions on test data

Evaluating model performance using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

RÂ² Score

Visualizing regression results (if applicable)

ðŸ›  Requirements:

Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, jupyter

ðŸŽ¯ Ideal For:

Beginners learning regression techniques

Comparing Decision Tree with other regression models

Applying regression on real-world datasets
